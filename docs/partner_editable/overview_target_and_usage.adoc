This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying {partner-product-name} on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users who wants to deploy and manage a high available (HA) AEM infrastructure on the AWS Cloud using the open-source platform AEM OpenCloud.


This Quick Start deploys an AEM OpenCloud Full-Set Architecture on the AWS Cloud with enabled HA features like https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling^],
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/introduction.html[Elastic Load Balancing^] & https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html[Amazon CloudFront^].

The AEM OpenCloud Full-Set gets deployed with the recommended HA configuration of two Author-Dispatcher, two Publish-Dispatcher and two AEM Publish instances across multiple availability zones in one AWS Region.
Further Amazon Cloudwatch alarms are configured to monitor the average CPU utilisation of the Publish-Dispatcher Auto Scaling group. The alarm is configured to scale out/in by one EC2 instance if the CPU Utilisation is above/below 50%, by not exceeding the configured minimum(2) or maximum(4) size of the Publish-Dispatcher Auto Scaling Group.
The Orchestrator application manages AEM replication and flush agents as instances are getting created and terminated.
