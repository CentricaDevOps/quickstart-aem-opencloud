AEM OpenCloud is an open-source platform for running AEM on AWS. It provides an out of the box solution for provisioning a highly available AEM architecture which implements auto-scaling, auto-recovery, chaos-testing, CDN, multi-level backup, bluegreen deployment, repository upgrade, security, and monitoring capabilities by leveraging a multitude of AWS services.

The {partner-product-name} workloads are deployed on multiple Amazon EC2 instances for improved performance. The content-delivery and content-management web server roles can be scaled for high availability. Other {partner-product-name} roles have restrictions on active/active roles and are designed for active/passive standby. Due to this, other {partner-product-name} roles belong to their own Auto Scaling groups as single instances. Should an instance become unavailable, itâ€™s replaced by a new instance and configured with a {partner-product-name} role of the same type.

Website content can be deployed to the content-delivery and content-management roles using your choice of deployment process.
